### Julia Evans
[[link](http://www.jvns.ca/)]

[Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk) is just amazing. Her blog is an outstanding collection of write-ups that goes deep into a variety of systems, the human aspects of Software Engineering. I just want to quote this paragraph from her "about" page that basically is the secret of success:
> I have one main opinion about programming, which is that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use (the browser, the kernel, the operating system, the network layers, your database, HTTP, whatever youâ€™re running on top of) is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and be able to solve hard problems.

The [zines](https://wizardzines.com/) she produces are awesome and you should definitely check them out!

### Path sensitive

He doesn't write as often as some of the other authors I mentioned, but they are total eye-openers. [[Example](http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html)].
