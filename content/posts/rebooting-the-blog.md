Here is the third boot of my blog. This time around, I'll be discarding the old stuff and start from scratch. Hopefully, this time I'll automate it enough so that it wouldn't be as PITA as it was the last time. I never used github actions for automating the build for my blog before, but it is worth a try.

**Update**: Works like a charm!
