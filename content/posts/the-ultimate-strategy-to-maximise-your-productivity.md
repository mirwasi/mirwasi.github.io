### Prioritize tasks

Start by **_identifying your most important tasks and priorities_**, and **_allocate the majority of your time and energy_** to these tasks. Use the 80/20 rule (Pareto's Law) to focus on the 20% of tasks that will produce 80% of your results.

### Use Parkinson's Law to your advantage

Give yourself **_a tight deadline for each task_**, and work to complete it within that time frame. This will help you avoid the tendency for work to expand to fill the time available.

### Focus on one task at a time

Use the Law of Focus to **_avoid multitasking_** and instead focus on completing one task at a time. This will help you to be more productive and avoid distractions.

### Minimize interruptions

Use Carlson's Law to **_anticipate interruptions and add extra time to your schedule_**, or try to **_minimize interruptions by reducing distractions_** and creating a quiet, focused work environment.

### Estimate task time accurately

Use Illich's Law to **_estimate the time each task will take as accurately as possible_**, and try to avoid overestimating the amount of time required. This will help you to avoid taking longer to complete tasks than necessary.

### Use rewards to motivate yourself

Use the Law of Reward to **_motivate yourself and reinforce good time management habits_**. Reward yourself for completing tasks on time, and use the satisfaction of completing tasks efficiently as a motivator.
