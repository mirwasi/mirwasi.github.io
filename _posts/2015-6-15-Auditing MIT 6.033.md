title: MIT 6.033 - Computer System Engineering
---

Inspired by this <a href="http://devblog.me/systems-class.html">post</a> by Slava Kim, I've decided to audit MIT's 6.033 (Computer Systems Engineering). I wanted to know more about systems, ones that are large, complex and distributed. To keep myself stick to this, I've decided to write a blog post on every class. I'm going to follow the class schedule of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/schedule.shtml">Spring 2015</a> session.

Why blog posts on classes? Well, to make sure I understand everything correctly. I'm going to write down the basic ideas as clearly as I can.
