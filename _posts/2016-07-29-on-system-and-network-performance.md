title: On system and network performance
---

I've been really interested in system's performance these days and my material for the next free slot of available time would be these:

### Brendan Gregg on various performance analysis tools

I've used a little bit of [statprofiler](https://github.com/mbarbon/devel-statprofiler) at my workplace to gauge the performance of some Perl code. I liked those flame graphs, and digging a bit, I came across this amazing guy called [Brendan Gregg](www.brendangregg.com) from Netflix. He is a well known performance expert.

A couple of highly recommended videos:

### High Performance Browser Networking

I also came across this nice free online book called [High Performance Browser Networking](https://hpbn.co/) by Ilya Grigorik on reddit. I hope to finish the entire book someday in near future. This book starts from very basic things like TCP and UDP to HTTP/2. The good thing about this book seems the performance optimization tips given at the end of each chapter.
