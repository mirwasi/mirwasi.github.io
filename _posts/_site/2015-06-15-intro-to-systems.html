<blockquote>
  <p>“A set of interconnected components that has an expected behavior observed at the interface with its environment”.</p>

<p>Complexity makes designing system very difficult.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-complexity-mean-how-does-one-define-complexity">What does complexity mean? How does one define complexity?</h3>

<p>A complex system has got:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>large number</strong> of components and connections.</li>
  <li><strong>irregular</strong> design.</li>
  <li>a design that is <strong>difficult to describe</strong>.</li>
  <li>a design that takes <strong>a lot of people</strong> to maintain.</li>
</ul>

<p>One metric to measure the complexity of a system is the <em>number of lines of code</em>. It’s not the best metric, but gives a rough estimation. (Facebook’s front end alone has 62-million lines of code!)</p>

<p><strong>The more the lines of code, the more complex the system it creates.</strong></p>

<p>More complexity:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>limits</strong> what we can build.</li>
  <li>more <strong>expensive</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>harder</strong> to maintain.</li>
  <li>easier to <strong>break</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better#The_MIT_approach">MIT approach</a> leads to more complex designs, since it puts the least priority on simplicity.</p>

<p>###Problems created by complexity:###</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New properties</strong> emerges when components are <strong>joined together</strong>:
These properties are not evident when components are seen as individuals. When components are glued together to build a system, newer properties emerges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small designs <strong>don’t work very well at scale</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Small changes</strong> to to system lead to surprisingly <strong>large after effects</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mitigation-of-complexity-modularity-and-abstraction">Mitigation of complexity: Modularity and abstraction!</h3>

<p>Modular systems are divided into <strong>components, or modules</strong>, such that we can
consider the implementation and interfaces of these modules
<strong>separately</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Example</em>: We don’t need to know how a transistor works in order to program, or how assembly language works to use Java, or how Java works to use a word processor implemented in it.</p>

<p>Modular systems are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>easier</strong> to reason about, change/improve and manage.</li>
  <li>modules <strong>fail independently</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="common-modularityabstraction-techniques">Common modularity/abstraction techniques:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Layering</strong>:</p>

    <p><em>Example</em>: network protocols. Any layer can be built/modified without caring about the others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hierarchy</strong>:</p>

    <p><em>Example</em>: routing.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="types-of-modularity">Types of modularity:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Soft modularity:</strong>  A type of modularity where the modules have to <strong>follow a contract</strong> that has a set of rules in which the modules are <strong>not suppose to violate</strong>.</p>

    <p><em>Example:</em> Modularization by functions. Functions must be implemented/used in the stated way. Otherwise, bad things can happedn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enforced modularity:</strong> A type of modularity where the modules are <strong>prevented from violating the rules</strong> by <strong>implementing self-protecting codes</strong> that protect a module’s integrity.</p>

    <p><em>Example:</em> Client/Server modularity, virtualization.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>bigger</strong> the system gets, the <strong>more complex</strong> it becomes.</li>
  <li>Modularity and abstraction can <strong>reduce the complexity</strong> of a system.</li>
  <li>Getting <strong>correct</strong> modularity/abstraction is a <strong>challenge</strong>.</li>
  <li>Modularity <strong>should be enforced</strong>.</li>
</ul>
