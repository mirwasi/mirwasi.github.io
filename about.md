I am a self-taught Software Engineer living in London, one of the great world cities. I work at Amazon (opinions expressed in this blog are entirely my own).

Before coming here, I lived on the other side of North Sea, in Amsterdam, for two years. Originally hailing from Bangladesh, I've always had a great interest in anything related to comptuers. I think I saw my first comptuers in 1997/98 when a friend of my uncle lent his 66Mhz processor computer (with a monochrome monitor) to my father, who wanted to learn WordPerfect. In reality, I used it most of the time playing games like Prince of Persia 2 and Raptor. I got my "own" computer in 2001, wrote my first program in Quick Basic in the same year. Since then it's been a great journey as a programmer. 


### Some of the stuff I did
- ACM ICPC World Finalist in 2012 (Warsaw, Poland). ACM ICPC is considered to be the most prestigious programming competitions in the world.

- Co-instructed introductory programming language web course in Bengali called [প্রোগ্রামিংয়ে হাতে খড়ি](https://programming-course.appspot.com/preview).

- Volunteered to organize Bangladesh Informatics Olympiad in 2012 and 2013.

- Co-ordinated the preparation of task to be used in Qazi Azher Ali National Programming Contest and BUET National Programming Contest.
