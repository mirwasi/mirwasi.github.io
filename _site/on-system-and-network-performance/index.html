<p>I’ve been really interested in system’s performance these days and my material for the next free slot of available time would be these:</p>

<p>I’ve used a little bit of <a href="https://github.com/mbarbon/devel-statprofiler">Statprofiler</a> at my workplace to gauge the performance of some Perl code. I liked those flame graphs, and digging a bit, I came across this amazing guy called <a href="www.brendangregg.com">Brendan Gregg</a> from Netflix. He is a well known performance expert.</p>

<p>A couple of highly recommended videos:</p>

<p>I also came across this nice free online book called <a href="https://hpbn.co/">High Performance Browser Networking</a> by Ilya Grigorik on reddit. I hope to finish the entire book someday in near future. This book starts from very basic things like TCP and UDP to HTTP/2. The good thing about this book seems the performance optimization tips given at the end of each chapter.</p>
